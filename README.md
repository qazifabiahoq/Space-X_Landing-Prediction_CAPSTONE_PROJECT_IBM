# **SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction**  

## **Project Overview**  
The commercial space industry is rapidly evolving, with companies striving to make space travel more cost-effective. SpaceX has revolutionized spaceflight by developing reusable rockets, significantly reducing launch costs. The Falcon 9 rocket, advertised at $62 million per launch, is much cheaper than competitors, mainly due to its reusable first stage.  

This project focuses on predicting whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land, thereby determining launch costs. Instead of relying on rocket science, machine learning models are used to analyze public launch data and predict first-stage reuse.  

The full report detailing all findings, methodologies, and results is available in the **"report.pdf"** file within the **"report"** folder of this repository.

- The extracted HTML table data was parsed and structured into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.  

## **Data Wrangling & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Launch sites were analyzed using `.value_counts()` to determine the number of launches per site.  
- The frequency of each orbit type was examined.  
- Mission outcomes were categorized into **landing success (1)** and **failure (0)** for machine learning.  
- Results were exported as a **CSV file** for modeling.  

## **Data Visualization**  
- Visualizations explored relationships between **flight numbers, launch sites, payloads, and success rates**.  
- Scatter plots analyzed **payload mass vs. orbit type** and **flight number vs. launch site**.  
- Yearly trends in launch success rates were also plotted.  

## **SQL-Based EDA**  
- The dataset was stored in a **SQLite database** and analyzed using SQLAlchemy.  
- Key insights extracted:  
  - **Total payload mass** carried by NASA (CRS) missions: **48,213 kg**.  
  - **Average payload mass** for booster version **F9 v1.1**: **2,928.4 kg**.  
  - **Date of first successful ground landing**: **July 22, 2018**.  

## **Geospatial Analysis**  
- Mapped launch sites with **Folium** and classified them based on landing success.

  - **Railways**: CCAFS LC-40 is near NASA Railway, aiding equipment transport.  
  - **Highways**: KSC LC-39A is close to Kennedy Parkway North for logistical efficiency.  
  - **Coastlines**: KSC LC-39A and CCAFS LC-40 benefit from safe launch trajectories over the ocean.  
  - **Cities**: Launch sites are strategically distant from urban areas for safety.  

## **Plotly Dash Dashboard**  
An interactive dashboard was developed using **Plotly Dash** to visualize:  
- **Launch success percentages** across different sites.  
  - **KSC LC-39A:** 49%  
  - **CCAFS SLC-40:** 12.5%  
  - **CCAFS LC-40:** 29.2%  
  - **VAFB SLC-4E:** 16.7%  
- **Scatter plots** showing payload mass vs. success rate.  
- **KSC LC-39A** had the highest launch success rate (**76.9%** success, **23.1%** failure).  
- **Low-weight payloads had a higher success rate** compared to heavier payloads.
